# ü§ê¬†Zipperlab Data

This is the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) "data" app ([Python](https://www.python.org/) package) that generates zip files for Zipperlab for [LabCAS](https://edrn-labcas.jpl.nasa.gov/) for the [Early Detection Research Network](https://edrn.nci.nih.gov/).


## üìù¬†Developer Notes

1.  LabCAS UI calls labcas-backend with the user session, email address, and Solr files query (since it knows only the UI + backend have the authentication of the user)
    -   ~~We could derive the email address through an LDAP query~~
        -   NO! Because this can be used for public data too
    -   UI could abort early at this point if it can determine the file size from the query
2.  LabCAS-backend calls Zipperlab with the shared secret, email address, and Solr files query
    -   Secret token is shared between the two entities
3.  Zipperlab asks Solr for the `FileSize` and makes an estimate about ZIP archive
    -   Compression ratio of 0.5 is what ChatGPT recommends
    -   However, knowing a lot of binary data (DICOM images?) maybe 0.4 is better
        -   Make this a tunable parameter (setting)
    -   If the estimated ZIP size is larger than 2GB, immediately abort
    -   Otherwise, return 200 OK and
        1.  Alert the user that the archive is being prepared
        2.  Launch a task to create the archive
4.  Archive file should be a UUID + `.zip`
5.  Once complete:
    1.  Send an email with the URL to the file ready for download
    2.  Start a task to delete the file after 7 days
        -   Will Celery be able to handle this? Might be better to use cron to just scan for old files
            -   Cron, definitely cron!

Okay, I think for a first pass we can leave out the status features


## Test Payload

```json
{
   "email" : "hello@a.co",
   "files" : [
      "/labcas-data/labcas-backend/archive/edrn/Prostate_MRI/Images_Site_ElkuApuKkJXw2A/6304573/DICOM/4109",
      "/labcas-data/labcas-backend/archive/edrn/Prostate_MRI/Images_Site_ElkuApuKkJXw2A/6304573/DICOM/4114",
      "/labcas-data/labcas-backend/archive/edrn/Prostate_MRI/Images_Site_ElkuApuKkJXw2A/6304573/DICOM/4115",
      "/labcas-data/labcas-backend/archive/edrn/Prostate_MRI/Images_Site_ElkuApuKkJXw2A/6304573/DICOM/4111",
      "/labcas-data/labcas-backend/archive/edrn/Prostate_MRI/Images_Site_ElkuApuKkJXw2A/6304573/DICOM/4110",
      "/labcas-data/labcas-backend/archive/edrn/Prostate_MRI/Images_Site_ElkuApuKkJXw2A/6304573/DICOM/4117",
      "/labcas-data/labcas-backend/archive/edrn/Prostate_MRI/Images_Site_ElkuApuKkJXw2A/6304573/DICOM/4188",
      "/labcas-data/labcas-backend/archive/edrn/Prostate_MRI/Images_Site_ElkuApuKkJXw2A/6304573/DICOM/4190",
      "/labcas-data/labcas-backend/archive/edrn/Prostate_MRI/Images_Site_ElkuApuKkJXw2A/6304573/DICOM/4904",
      "/labcas-data/labcas-backend/archive/edrn/Prostate_MRI/Images_Site_ElkuApuKkJXw2A/6304573/DICOM/4915"
   ],
   "operation" : "initiate"
}
```
You can save that to a file `/tmp/payload.json` and send it as follows:

    curl --request POST --data-binary @/tmp/payload.json http://localhost:6468/edrn/
